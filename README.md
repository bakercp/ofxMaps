ofxMaps
============

A slippy map addon. 

Inspired by https://github.com/RandomEtc/modestmaps-of and http://unfoldingmaps.org/


TODO:

- Add additional tile providers.
- Refactor map into map and map controller.
- Combine Coordinate / Location Classes w/ Point2D.
- Use ofVec2d rather than Point2d.
- Break into header + implementation files.
